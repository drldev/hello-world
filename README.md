# hello-world

I'm currently playing with all sorts of microcontrollers, ESP8266, D1 MINI, ESP32, Arduino etc, and plugging in just about every sensor and peripheral I can think of to explore IoT...

I've been programming in one form or another for over 40 years, going from programming at the opcode level, then through assemblers, macro assemblers, BASIC, Turbo C, Forth, Borland C++, VBA, VB6, VB.NET, C#, PHP, MSSQL, MySQL, SQLite, B4J, B4A, Java, IntelliJ, Blender, CuBase, and eventually training as a psychotherapist. Well, change is good! I wanted to see why computers drove me mad and now I know!
