# hello-world

I'm currently playing with ESP32 and Arduino, plugging in just about every sensor and peripheral I can think of, and exploring IoT...

Programming for 40 years, from opcodes, through assemblers, macro assemblers, BASIC, Turbo C, Forth, Borland C++, VBA, VB6, VB.NET, MSAccess, C#, PHP, MSSQL, MySQL, SQLite, B4J, B4A, B4R, Java, IntelliJ, Blender, CuBase, to training as a psychotherapist (I wanted to see why computers drove me mad. Now I know!)
